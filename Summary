The "Object Detection and Hazard Alert System for Child Safety" uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework to enhance child safety. It identifies objects like sharp tools, open flames, or electrical outlets in real time using a camera feed. The system analyzes the surroundings, detects potential hazards, and sends instant alerts to caregivers through sound or notifications. YOLO's speed and accuracy make it ideal for real-time applications, ensuring that parents or guardians can quickly intervene to prevent accidents. This innovative solution aims to create a safer environment for children by leveraging advanced object detection technology
